I am a fourth year PhD student in the Social Psychology program at NYU, working with <a href="http://www.jonbfreeman.com/">Dr. Jonathan B. Freeman</a> in the <a href="https://www.freemanlab.org/">Social Cognitive & Neural Sciences Lab</a>. I am interested in the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying social categorization. My past research has examined how age interacts with racial stereotypes.
