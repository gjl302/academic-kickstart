**Multiracial Categorization**

When we see another personâ€™s face, we rapidly and automatically categorize their race, gender, and age. Recent research on social categories has begun to examine how multiracial induviduals are categorized. I am interested in answering questions related to this topic. How do we categorize induviduals that are multiracial? How does multiracial categorization unfold as a dynamic process? How do our stereotypes and prejudices influence the activation of visual cues found in the face of a stranger?

Findings from my work suggest that perceivers experience a reflexive monoracial attraction that influences the efficency of multiracial categorizations. This reflexive attraction appears to be moderated by exposure to multiracial induviduals and influences later social evaluations.

**Intersectionality**

I am currently conducting research that aims to further our understanding of how people automatically encode intersectional identities and what factors influence their ability to recall recently learned intersectional identies.

**Geospatial Analysis of Stereotypes/Prejudice**

As part of my research on stereotypes and prejudice, I aim to model how enviormental factors like geographic location can influence the stereotypes and prejudice that percievers use when making split-second judgments of others. I am particularly interested in relating this to topics such as the rural vs. urban divide.
